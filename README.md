# üìö Programming Practice

A set of various programming exercises and projects in different languages and on different topics: algorithms, C/C++ languages, Pascal and assembler.

## üöÄ Repository Overview

'programming_practice' is a collection of three key sections:

1. **Algorithms** (`algorithms_practice/`)
2. **Practice in C and C++** (`c_and_c++_practice/`)
3. **First-year CMC MSU assignments** (`first_year_tries/`)

## üìÅ Structure and content

### [algorithms_practice/](algorithms_practice/)  
Implementations of popular tasks and algorithms from competition venues and own developments:  
- **Codeforces**: solutions to problems of various levels of complexity in C/C++.  
- **LeetCode**: classical problems (Palindrome, ZigZag, etc.) in C.
- **Learning algorithms** ('y_algorithms/`):
- Sorting: Merge, Quick, Radix  
  - Graphs: Dijkstra and its optimizations  
  - String algorithms: Z-function, string comparison  
  - A set of tests for fixing

### [c_and_c++_practice/](c_and_c++_practice/)  
A series of exercises and control papers on the course "Programming in C/C++":  
- **C++ Practice** (`c++_practice/`): laboratory work (`kr1`, `kr2`), practical tasks (`task_a`...`task_n`), final assessment  
- **C Practice** (`c_practice/`): multithreaded programming, strings, arrays, tasks `task_a`...`task_n`, test papers  
- Using Makefiles to automate the build

### [first_year_tries/](first_year_tries/)  
First-year assignments in Pascal and Assembler:
- **Pascal Practice** (`practice/`):
- Tasks 0-5: modules, input/output, trees, matrices  
  - Unit modules, test suites, .smtr specifications  
- **Assembly** (`.asm`): basic programs and Makefile  
- Demonstration of the principles of modularity and testing

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies and tools

- **Languages**:
- C, C++
- Pascal (Free Pascal)
- Assembler (NASM/MASM-compatible syntax)  
- **Assembly and Utilities**:
- GCC / G++
- Free Pascal Compiler ('fpc`)
- Make / Makefile  
- **Development environment**: any text editor or IDE (Code::Blocks, Visual Studio, CLion)
